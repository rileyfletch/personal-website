                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4">
                I&apos;m Riley, a computer science and data science student at the
                <a className="text-red font-semibold transition-all duration-700 hover:text-blue" href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science"> University of Virginia</a>, graduating in May 2025. 
                </p> 

                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4">
                At UVA, I&apos;m a teaching assistant for Computer Systems and Organization I and II,
                as well as a developer at <a className="text-red font-semibold transition-all duration-700 hover:text-green" href="https://thecourseforum.com/"> theCourseForum</a>.

                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4">
                I&apos;ve spent the past summers doing software engineering at Dell Technologies and the U.S. Navy, and information technology at Virginia Railway Express.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4"> 
                 I&apos;m super interested in all things low-level and high-scale; such as operating systems, computer networks, embedded systems, distributed systems, and infrastructure tooling.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4"> 
                 Long term, I&apos;d love to work on solving problems in cloud infra or distributed systems where optimizations for scale and attention to detail are invaluable.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl">
                Outside of tech I like reading and creative writing, playing guitar, tennis, and outdoorsy stuff like hiking and mountain biking. 
                I also enjoy learning about finance, history, and motorsports.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl mb-4 font-semibold">Experience.</p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl"> 
                    During the Summer of 2024, I was a software engineering intern at <a className="text-red font-semibold transition-all duration-700 hover:text-blue" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/storage-servers-and-networking-for-business/sf/power-store"> Dell Technologies </a> 
                    working for on the Powerstore team. I built developer tools for bottleneck identification and performance profiling
                    on backend components near the xNVMe drive interface, and FIO workload automation tooling that could be run against
                    devices on the appliance itself. I also spent some time backporting new features into legacy performance analyis tools.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl">
                I&apos;m a computer science teaching assistant at the University of Virginia where I instruct for
                Computer Systems and Organization I and II, the two introductory systems courses that teach about hardware design,
                circuits, x86 assembly, and C programming to learn about concurrency, virtual memory, and Linux internals.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl">
                    Summer of 2023, after my final year at community college, I was a software engineering intern
                    for the United States Navy, at the <a className="text-red font-semibold transition-all duration-700 hover:text-blue" href="https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Media/News/Article/1929358/navy-warfare-center-engineers-revolutionize-aegis-combat-system-training-with-c/"> Dahlgren research facility </a>. As a part of the CIAT team,
                    I worked on naval training software where I spent most of my time improving the existing software by
                    addressing security concerns, outdated programming methodologies, and adding unit tests. I was able
                    to experience working on a large software project, and was introduced to things like CI/CD, agile
                    development, proper version control, and working in a lab with hardware appliances.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-2xl">
                From the Summer of 2022 to Spring of 2023, I was an information technology intern at <a className="text-red font-semibold transition-all duration-700 hover:text-blue" href="https://www.vre.org/"> Virginia Railway Express </a>
                . As my first &apos;proper&apos; job,
                I learned a lot about working in a professional environment. Technically, I did
                a lot of physical networking both in-office and at train stations, shell scripting to automate
                tasks and aggegrate data, and general help desk stuff. This was a super unique experience, and easily one of my favorite places to work at.
