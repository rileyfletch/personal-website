## Future improvements...

Rehaul blog page and add MDX support so writing new articles is considerably easier
* Add filters (this is less relevant since the number of articles is quite limited currently)

Add some sort of filtering/list of technologies for projects page
* This is also not a huge deal since there is only a small number of projects on there right now

Add better animations
* Currently animations are limited; add more (subtle) animations to general page transitions and link highlights, etc.
